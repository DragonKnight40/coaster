K'nex roller coaster dual-train control system, by Stephen Morawski

Controls 3 motors: block brake engage/disengage, station gates open/closed, and station tire drives
Has 4 sensors: block brake limit switch, station gates limit switch, brake run reed switch, and station reed switch

The roller coaster circuit is set up so that there is a main station and a block brake section immediately behind it that can stop and hold a train, and this is at an incline so that once the block brake disengages, the train will naturally move forward to the station with gravity. The station has gates that can open and close to mimic the gates that can let guests onto a train in a real roller coaster, and tire drives protruding from the track in the station to push the train forward. In the station, the train will stop when the tires stop.
